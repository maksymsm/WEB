                <ul>
                  <li>Max Planck submitted his habilitation thesis at the University of Munich in the year 1880 and was
                    appointed as a lecturer of physics at the University. In 1885, the University of Kiel appointed him as an associate professor.</li>
                  <li>In 1889, following the death of Gustav Kirchhoff, a position was vacant at the University of Berlin and Max Planck was invited to
                    fill that position. In 1892, Planck was appointed as a full professor there and continued to work in Berlin till the end of his career.</li>
                  <li>Max Planck started working on black body radiation in 1894 at the behest of corporations which wanted to produce light bulbs that produced
                    a lot of light but without consuming too much electricity. After a period of doubt and frustration when the work could not be accomplished; Planck
                     came up with the Planck black-body radiation law six years after first starting work on the project.</li>
                  <li>After being appointed as a professor at the University of Berlin, Max Planck wanted to bring together all the physical societies present in his
                    native Germany under one roof and it was because of him that the Physical Societies of Germany came into being in the year 1898. Planck also served
                    as the President of the society for four years later on.</li>
                  <li>Max Planck is without doubt one of the greatest physicists ever and his greatest work has to be the tenuous research that he conducted on quantum
                     physics that opened up an altogether new branch of study in the subject.</li>
                  <li>Max Planck was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918 for establishing a new branch of study in physics.</li>
                  <li>He was awarded the coveted Lorentz Medal in 1927 and the Copley Medal in 1929.</li>
