          <li>Max Planck submitted his habilitation thesis at the University of Munich in the year 1880 and was
            appointed as a lecturer of physics at the University. In 1885, the University of Kiel appointed him as an associate professor.</li>
          <li>In 1889, following the death of Gustav Kirchhoff, a position was vacant at the University of Berlin and Max Planck was invited to
            fill that position. In 1892, Planck was appointed as a full professor there and continued to work in Berlin till the end of his career.</li>
          <li>Max Planck started working on black body radiation in 1894 at the behest of corporations which wanted to produce light bulbs that produced
            a lot of light but without consuming too much electricity. After a period of doubt and frustration when the work could not be accomplished; Planck
             came up with the Planck black-body radiation law six years after first starting work on the project.</li>
          <li>After being appointed as a professor at the University of Berlin, Max Planck wanted to bring together all the physical societies present in his
            native Germany under one roof and it was because of him that the Physical Societies of Germany came into being in the year 1898. Planck also served
            as the President of the society for four years later on.</li>
          <li>Max Planck retired from the University of Berlin in 1928 and his later years were largely unhappy due to the rise of the Nazis under Adolf Hitler.
             Although he was completely at odds with the philosophy of the Nazis he decided to stay back in Germany and asked other scientists to do as well.</li>
